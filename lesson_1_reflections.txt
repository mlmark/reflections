How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It eliminated having to search rows that were identical in each file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier access to techniques I've used in the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You're creating historical records, not just backups.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is creating a record of your work.  Google Docs is creating a back-up.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to find the versions of interest, use git diff to find all lines that differ between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always get back to a pre-break version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Android app.
